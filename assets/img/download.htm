The modern script is quite similar to the well-known Billabong font, but the typeface was improved and began to possess a unique and inimitable style. The elegance of design was achieved due to the prevalence of cursive lines which are perfect for branding projects. The font for the Instagram logo is primarily a laconic and stylish design in a simple black color and accurately redrawn curved letters.","inLanguage":"en-US"},"inLanguage":"en-US"},{"@type":"Question","@id":"https://turbologo.com/articles/instagram-logo/#faq-question-1647230698633","position":2,"url":"https://turbologo.com/articles/instagram-logo/#faq-question-1647230698633","name":"What camera is the Instagram logo?","answerCount":1,"acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Since the founder of Instagram was a fond of film photography himself, it is not at all surprising that the brand's logo features a camera. To be more precise, it is the vintage Bell &amp; Howell camera, which looks very simplified at the moment, representing the shape of a smoothed square with a circle in the center as a lens and a small dot in the upper right corner as a flash. Historically, the logo has gone from being Polaroid-inspired to a detailed drawn of the Sierre 120 with a rainbow stripes that symbolized app filters.","inLanguage":"en-US"},"inLanguage":"en-US"},{"@type":"Question","@id":"https://turbologo.com/articles/instagram-logo/#faq-question-1647230702865","position":3,"url":"https://turbologo.com/articles/instagram-logo/#faq-question-1647230702865","name":"Who created the Instagram logo?","answerCount":1,"acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"With a desire to replace an outdated design Jan Spalter focused on creating new outlines of the logo, consisting of camera silhouettes.

Sharing and taking photographs are the main features of the app, so the camera is an irreplaceable attribute of photography and without its application, the very idea of capturing images and obtaining photographs would be feasible. In addition, the founder of Instagram was inspired by the hipster culture and the popular Polaroids at the time.","inLanguage":"en-US"},"inLanguage":"en-US"},{"@type":"Question","@id":"https://turbologo.com/articles/instagram-logo/#faq-question-1647230711923","position":5,"url":"https://turbologo.com/articles/instagram-logo/#faq-question-1647230711923","name":"What are the colors of the Instagram logo?","answerCount":1,"acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"At the moment, the icon did the re-branding with the advent of the new interface and came to a minimalist design with a bright gradient from orange to pink. The predominant color of the gradient is pink, while this choice of colors is reminiscent of the colors of a sunset.

Digital online technology companies’ advantages can become their drawbacks. Your favorite application logo will catch your eye immediately and you’ll be wanting to learn more. Also, changes towards more clear and clean design often contribute greatly to the success of such companies. The more an icon looks simple and friendly, the more users will click it. And every click brings profit nowadays. That’s why, when developing a logo for a service like Instagram it is important to remember that logo clarity means clear and opportune functionality.</p><div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1647230690257"><strong class="schema-faq-question">What is the font for the Instagram logo?</strong><p class="schema-faq-answer">The Instagram logo was handwritten especially for the brand by a typographer and designer Mackey Saturday. The modern script is quite similar to the well-known Billabong font, but the typeface was improved and began to possess a unique and inimitable style. The elegance of design was achieved due to the prevalence of cursive lines which are perfect for branding projects. The font for the Instagram logo is primarily a laconic and stylish design in a simple black color and accurately redrawn curved letters.</p></div><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1647230698633"><strong class="schema-faq-question">What camera is the Instagram logo?</strong><p class="schema-faq-answer">Since the founder of Instagram was a fond of film photography himself, it is not at all surprising that the brand&#8217;s logo features a camera. To be more precise, it is the vintage Bell &amp; Howell camera, which looks very simplified at the moment, representing the shape of a smoothed square with a circle in the center as a lens and a small dot in the upper right corner as a flash. Historically, the logo has gone from being Polaroid-inspired to a detailed drawn of the Sierre 120 with a rainbow stripes that symbolized app filters.</p></div><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1647230702865"><strong class="schema-faq-question">Who created the Instagram logo?</strong><p class="schema-faq-answer">With a desire to replace an outdated design Jan Spalter focused on creating new outlines of the logo, consisting of camera silhouettes. It was he and his colleagues who replaced the logo depicting the previous instant camera by Cole Rise with a more monochrome option.</p></div><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1647230707286"><strong class="schema-faq-question">Why is there a camera on the Instagram logo?</strong><p class="schema-faq-answer">Since the concept of the application is based on adding user’s photos or videos to the feed in the form of a photo album, it is not surprising that it is the camera-shaped icon placed as a major on the Instagram logo. Sharing and taking photographs are the main features of the app, so the camera is an irreplaceable attribute of photography and without its application, the very idea of capturing images and obtaining photographs would be feasible. In addition, the founder of Instagram was inspired by the hipster culture and the popular Polaroids at the time.</p></div><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1647230711923"><strong class="schema-faq-question">What are the colors of the Instagram logo?</strong><p class="schema-faq-answer">At the moment, the icon did the re-branding with the advent of the new interface and came to a minimalist design with a bright gradient from orange to pink. The predominant color of the gradient is pink, while this choice of colors is reminiscent of the colors of a sunset. The Instagram logo has evolved from the original black-and-white version to the colorful and smooth variation of it.</p></div></div><div class="saboxplugin-wrap" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person" itemscope itemprop="author"><div class="saboxplugin-tab"><div class="saboxplugin-gravatar"><img alt='' src="//turbologo.com/articles/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-lazy-type="image" data-src='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/227e182dfb1b824e5a150c453121a92b?s=100&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g' srcset="" data-srcset='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/227e182dfb1b824e5a150c453121a92b?s=200&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g 2x' class='lazy lazy-hidden avatar avatar-100 photo' height='100' width='100' itemprop="image" loading='lazy'/><noscript><img alt='' src="//turbologo.com/articles/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-lazy-type="image" data-src='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/227e182dfb1b824e5a150c453121a92b?s=100&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g' srcset="" data-srcset='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/227e182dfb1b824e5a150c453121a92b?s=200&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g 2x' class='lazy lazy-hidden avatar avatar-100 photo' height='100' width='100' itemprop="image" loading='lazy'/><noscript><img alt='' src='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/227e182dfb1b824e5a150c453121a92b?s=100&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g' srcset='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/227e182dfb1b824e5a150c453121a92b?s=200&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-100 photo' height='100' width='100' itemprop="image" loading='lazy'/></noscript></noscript></div><div class="saboxplugin-authorname"><a href="https://turbologo.com/articles/author/victoriamaybach/" class="vcard author" rel="author" itemprop="url" data-wpel-link="internal"><span class="fn" itemprop="name">Victoria Maybach</span></a></div><div class="saboxplugin-desc"><div itemprop="description"><p class="p1">Blog editor and content marketing specialist at Turbologo.
